        <p>But psychologist, Jeffrey Karpicke, has shown that this approach is actually much less productive than another, very simple, technique. Recall. After you&rsquo;ve read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you&rsquo;ve just read.</p>
<p>Karpicke&rsquo;s research, published in the Journal Science, provided solid evidence along these lines. Students studied a scientific text and then practiced it, by recalling as much of the information as they could. Then they re-studied the text and recalled it again. That is, they tried to remember the key ideas, once more. The results, in the same amount of time, by simply practising and recalling the material students learned far more and at a much deeper level than they did using any other approach. Including simply rereading the text a number of times. Or drawing concept maps that supposedly enrich the relationships in the materials under study. This improved learning comes whether students take a formal test, or just informally test themselves. This gives an important reminder. When we retrieve knowledge, we&rsquo;re not just being mindless robots. The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning, and helps us to begin forming chunks. It&rsquo;s almost as if the recall process helps build in little neural hooks, that we can hang our thinking on.

Even more of a surprise to researchers, was that the students themselves predicted that simply reading and recalling the materials, wasn&rsquo;t the best way to learn. They thought, concept mapping, drawing diagrams that show the relationship between the concepts would be the best. But if you&rsquo;re trying to build connections between chunks, before the basic chunks are embedded in the brain, it doesn&rsquo;t work as well. It&rsquo;s like trying to learn advanced strategy in chess, before you even understand the basic concepts of how the pieces move.

Using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make your study time more focused and effective. The only time rereading text seems to be effective, is if you let time pass between the rereading, so that it becomes more of an exercise in spaced repetition.</p>
