        <p>The bigger and more well-practiced your chunked mental library, whatever the subject you&rsquo;re learning, the more easily you&rsquo;ll be able to solve problems and figure out solutions.</p>
<p>Chunking isn&rsquo;t all you&rsquo;ll need to develop creative flexibility in your learning, but it&rsquo;s an important component. C</p>
<p>hunks can also help you understand new concepts. This is because when you grasp one chunk, you&rsquo;ll find that that chunk can be related in surprising ways to similar chunks, not only in that field but also in very different fields. This idea is called <strong>transfer</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, concepts and problem solving method you learned for physics, can be very similar to chunked concepts in business. I found some aspects of language learning were very helpful for me when I later began to learn computer programming.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re trying to figure something out, if you have a good library of these chunks, you can more easily skip to the right solution by metaphorically speaking, listening to whispers from your diffuse mode. Your diffuse mode can help you connect two or more chunks together in new ways to solve novel problems.</p>
<p>In building a chunked library, you&rsquo;re training your brain to recognize not only a specific concept, but different types and classes of concepts so that you can automatically know how to solve quickly or handle whatever you encounter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll start to see patterns and simplify problem-solving for you and will soon find that different solution techniques are lurking at the edge of your memory. Before midterms or finals, it can be easy to brush up and have these solutions at the mental ready.</p>
<p>You may think there are so many problems and concepts just in a single section or chapter of whatever you&rsquo;re studying. There&rsquo;s just no way to learn them all. This is where <strong>the law of Serendipity</strong> comes into play. <strong>Lady Luck favors the one who tries.</strong> Just focus on whatever section you&rsquo;re studying. You&rsquo;ll find that once you put that first problem or concept in your mental library, whatever it is, then the second concept will go in a little more easily and the third more easily still. <strong>Not that all of this is a snap, but it does get easier.</strong></p>
