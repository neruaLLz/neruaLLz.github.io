      <description>Should you organize your material into a single document or into a set of documents in a website? Consider the following guidelines:
How-to guides, introductory overviews, and conceptual guides often work better as shorter documents when aimed at readers who are new to the subject matter. For example, a reader who is completely new to your subject matter might struggle to remember lots of new terms, concepts, and facts. Remember that your audience might be reading your documentation to gain a quick and general overview of the topic.</description>

      <description>Good sentences in technical documentation identify who is doing what to whom.
An imperative verb is a command. Many items in numbered lists start with imperative verbs. Sentences that start with an imperative verb imply an actor. The implied actor is you.
Use the active voice most of the time. Use the passive voice sparingly. Be boldâ€”be active.
In technical writing, clarity takes precedence over all other rules.
To engage and educate readers, choose precise, strong, specific verbs.</description>
