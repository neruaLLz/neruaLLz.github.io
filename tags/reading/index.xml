I have a childhood friend who recently moved into my home.
Although he still has 11 years left on his sentence, he is trying to appeal for a lesser term.
I am hopeful their relationship will end before he is released. Otherwise, I fear for her safety; I can see the red flags every day.
A separate issue is how you and your friends would feel if your roommate asked you to accept the presence of someone who caused all of you enormous distress, even if it was many years ago.</description>
