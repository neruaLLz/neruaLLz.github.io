      <description>霾霾霾 北京
感觉自己像一个被焦虑和迷茫裹着的苦瓜人。面试没结果。
想静下心来写完论文，看完 LHL，学完 Python，练习翻译，入门游戏本地化，看很多想看的书，比如最近翻译的文章提到的《中国剩女》这本书。
但总是像鼓面一样，不停被焦虑鼓槌敲打。
打工人不想工作，没有工作的人急于找到工作。
看到今天的好运和牛奶有关，我早上就喝掉一瓶牛奶了，怎么好运还没来呢？难道要喝两瓶吗？那会长痘痘的。</description>

      <description>Loop: When you want to do the same action with every item in a list, you can use Python’s for loop. (p. 50)
Expected an indented block after &amp;lsquo;for&amp;rsquo; statement on line 3
Every indented line following the line for magician in magicians is considered inside the loop, and each indented line is executed once for each value in the list. (p. 52)
Any lines of code after the for loop that are not indented are executed once without repetition.</description>

Attracting signatures from the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, the letter, released early last week, advocates for a 6-month moratorium to give AI companies and regulators time to formulate safeguards to protect society from potential risks of the technology.
AI has galloped along since the launch last year of the image generator DALL-E 2, from the Microsoft-backed company OpenAI.
The company has since released ChatGPT and GPT-4, two text-generating chatbots, to frenzied acclaim.</description>

I have a childhood friend who recently moved into my home.
Although he still has 11 years left on his sentence, he is trying to appeal for a lesser term.
I am hopeful their relationship will end before he is released. Otherwise, I fear for her safety; I can see the red flags every day.
A separate issue is how you and your friends would feel if your roommate asked you to accept the presence of someone who caused all of you enormous distress, even if it was many years ago.</description>
