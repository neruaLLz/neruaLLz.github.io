Attracting signatures from the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, the letter, released early last week, advocates for a 6-month moratorium to give AI companies and regulators time to formulate safeguards to protect society from potential risks of the technology.
AI has galloped along since the launch last year of the image generator DALL-E 2, from the Microsoft-backed company OpenAI.
The company has since released ChatGPT and GPT-4, two text-generating chatbots, to frenzied acclaim.</description>

I have a childhood friend who recently moved into my home.
Although he still has 11 years left on his sentence, he is trying to appeal for a lesser term.
I am hopeful their relationship will end before he is released. Otherwise, I fear for her safety; I can see the red flags every day.
A separate issue is how you and your friends would feel if your roommate asked you to accept the presence of someone who caused all of you enormous distress, even if it was many years ago.</description>
